# The US-RSE Association Conference 2023 (USRSECon23)

This repo is website landing page for the US-RSE Association Conference 2023,
happening October 16-18 in Chicago, IL.

## Previewing the Site Locally

To preview the site locally, you'll need to [install jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
Then go to the root of the directory and run (only needed once):

```bash
$ bundle install
```

Then run 

```bash
$ jekyll serve
# or
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

and open your browser to <http://localhost:4000>.

If you are having trouble try `rm -rf _site`, followed by `bundle update`,
then `bundle exec jekyll serve`.


## Container-based development

Build and run a Docker container to preview the site locally and support a local development workflow.

Build the container image:

```bash
$ docker build -t us-rse-website:latest .
```

Run the container to access the website at the URL http://127.0.0.1:4000/usrse23/

```bash
$ docker run --rm -it -p 4000:4000 us-rse-website:latest 
Configuration file: /srv/jekyll/_config.yml
            Source: /srv/jekyll
       Destination: /srv/jekyll/_site
 Incremental build: disabled. Enable with --incremental
      Generating... 
                    done in 1.616 seconds.
 Auto-regeneration: enabled for '/srv/jekyll'
    Server address: http://0.0.0.0:4000/usrse23/
  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
```

To develop the website, launch the container using the following command, where the source files are mounted into the container:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 4000:4000 \
    -v $(pwd):/srv/jekyll
    us-rse-website:latest \
    bundle exec jekyll serve --host=0.0.0.0 --watch --drafts
```

Change a source file, such as `index.html` for example, and save the changes. You will see Jekyll automatically regenerate the site, after which you can reload the page in your browser to see the rendered changes.
