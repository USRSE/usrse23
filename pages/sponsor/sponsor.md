## Introduction

Dear Prospective US-RSE 2023 Conference Sponsor,

We are delighted to invite you to join us for the first-ever United States Research
Software Engineer (US-RSE) Conference (Chicago, October 16-18, 2023)! This year's
theme is "*Software Enabled Discovery and Beyond*".

The US-RSE Association is the leading professional community of research software
engineering practitioners in the United States. The organization and its members are
dedicated to creating research software that is fit for purpose, sustainable over the
long-term and reliably developed and supported. Our members come from diverse
backgrounds, but we share a common goal: *to support and promote the role of research
software  and research software engineers in driving innovation and solving complex problems*.

As a sponsor of the US-RSE Conference, you will have the opportunity to connect with a
professional community and interact with talented expertise and leadership in the field
of research software engineering. You will also support the advancement of critical
research and development efforts across various disciplines and domains.

Topics of interest for this year's conference include *software-enabled discovery,
architectures, frameworks, libraries, and technology trends, research data management,
reproducibility, and sustainability*. We will also explore diversity, equity, and
inclusion issues in research software engineering, workforce development, and building
a robust and sustainable RSE profession.

We hope you will consider joining us for this exciting event and supporting the US-RSE
community. Sponsorship provides an opportunity to help this expanding field mature and
provides a great way to connect your organization with in demand professional talent.
The attached prospectus describes sponsorship options and benefits.

Thank you for your consideration, and we look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Conference General Chairs, Sandra Gesing | Julia Damerow
