long papers will be 15 minutes). Both types of submissions will be included
in the digital proceedings. 

Papers should follow the [IEEE format](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html). Short papers should have not more than 500 words and long papers should be no-longer than 8 pages in length.
