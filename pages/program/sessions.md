Scientific research is a highly collaborative activity, and gateways can play an important role by providing shared data management tools that reduce the need for advanced expertise in file system administration. We describe a recently implemented architecture for collaborative file management in the Core science gateway architecture developed at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC). Our implementation is built on the Tapis Systems API, which provides endpoints that enable users to securely manage access to their research data.</p>

        <p>This paper examines the potential of containerization technology, specifically the CyVerse Discovery Environment (DE), as a solution to the reproducibility crisis in research. The DE is a platform service designed to facilitate data-driven discoveries through reproducible analyses. It offers features like data management, app integration, and app execution. The DE is built on a suite of microservices deployed within a Kubernetes cluster, handling different aspects of the system, from app management to data storage. Reproducibility is ensured by maintaining records of the software, its dependencies, and instructions for its execution. The DE also provides a RESTful web interface, the Terrain API, for creating custom user interfaces. The application of the DE is illustrated through a use case involving the University of Arizona Superfund Research Center, where the DE's data storage capabilities were utilized to manage data and processes. The paper concludes that the DE facilitates efficient and reproducible research, eliminating the need for substantial hardware investment and complex data management, thereby propelling scientific progress.</p>

        <p>Single-page applications (SPAs) have become indispensable in modern frontend development, with widespread adoption in scientific applications. The process of creating a single-page web application development environment which accurately reflects the production environment isn’t always straightforward. Most SPA build systems assume configuration at build time, while DevSecOps engineers prefer runtime config- uration. This paper suggests a framework-agnostic approach to address issues that encompass both development and deployment, but are difficult to tackle without knowledge in both domains.</p>

          “Experiences in how RSE community identity leads to improved research software practices”, Daniel S. Katz

    </div>

    <div id="collapseOne" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingOne" data-parent="#accordion">
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>Research software once was a heroic and lonely activity, particularly in research computing and in HPC. But today, research software is a social activity, in the senses that most software depends on other software, and that most software that is intended to be used by more than one person is written by more than one person. These social factors have led to generally accepted practices for code development and maintenance and for interactions around code. This paper examines how these practices form, become accepted, and later change in different contexts. In addition, given that research software engineering (RSEng) and research software engineers (RSEs) are becoming accepted parts of the research software endeavor, it looks at the role of RSEs in creating, adapting, and infusing these practices. It does so by examining aspects around practices at three levels: in communities, projects, and groups. Because RSEs are often the point where new practices become accepted and then disseminated, this paper suggests that tool and practice developers should be working to get RSE champions to adopt their tools and practices, and that people who seek to understand research software practices should be studying RSEs. It also suggests areas for further research to test this idea.</p>

          “Academic OSPO & RSE Group: Engaging Students in Open and Collaborative Development”, Daniel Shown
        </button>
      </h5>
    </div>

    <div id="collapse42" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="heading42" data-parent="#accordion">
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>The growing recognition of research software as a fundamental component of the scientific process has led to the establishment of both Open Source Program Office (OSPO) as a Research Software Engineering (RSE) groups. These groups aim to enhance software engineering practices within research projects, enabling robust and sustainable software solutions. The integration of an OSPO into an RSE group within a university environment provides an intriguing fusion of open source principles and research software engineering expertise. The utilization of students as developers within such a program highlights their unique contributions along with the benefits and challenges involved.</p>
        <p>Engaging students as developers in an OSPO-RSE group brings numerous advantages. It provides students with valuable experience in real-world software development, enabling them to bridge the gap between academia and industry. By actively participating in open source projects, students can refine their technical skills, learn industry best practices, and gain exposure to collaborative software development workflows. Involving students in open source projects enhances their educational experience. They have the opportunity to work on meaningful research software projects alongside experienced professionals, tackling real-world challenges and making tangible contributions to the scientific community. This exposure to open source principles and practices fosters a culture of innovation, collaboration, and knowledge sharing.</p>
        <p>This approach also raises questions. How can the objectives and metrics of success for an academic OSPO-RSE group be defined and evaluated? What governance models and collaboration mechanisms are required to balance the academic freedom of researchers with the community-driven nature of open source? How can the potential conflicts between traditional academic practices and the open source ethos be effectively addressed? How can teams balance academic commitments with project timelines? These questions highlight the need for careful consideration and exploration of the organizational, cultural, and ethical aspects associated with an OSPO acting as an RSE group within a university.</p>
        <p>Leveraging student developers in an OSPO-RSE group also presents challenges that need careful consideration. Students may have limited experience in software engineering practices, requiring mentoring and guidance to ensure the quality and sustainability of the research software they contribute to. Balancing academic commitments with project timelines and expectations can also be a challenge, necessitating effective project management strategies and clear communication channels. Furthermore, the ethical considerations of involving students as developers in open source projects must be addressed, ensuring the protection of intellectual property, respecting licensing requirements, and maintaining data privacy.</p>
        <p>The involvement of students as developers within an OSPO-RSE group offers valuable benefits. The effective integration of students in this context requires thoughtful planning, mentorship, and attention to ethical considerations. This talk will examine the experience of the Open Source with SLU program to explore the dynamic role of student developers in an OSPO-RSE program and engage in discussions on best practices, challenges, and the future potential of this distinctive approach to research software engineering within academia.</p>

    <div id="collapseFour" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingFour" data-parent="#accordion">
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>This talk presents research on the prevalence of research software as academic research output within international institutional repositories (IRs).  This work expands on previous research, which examined 182 academic IRs from 157 universities in the UK.  Very low quantities of records of research software were found in IRs and that the majority of IRs could not contain software as independent records of research output due to the underlying Research Information System (RIS) platform.  This has implications for the quantities of software returned as part of the UK's Research Excellence Framework (REF), which seeks to assess the quality of research in UK universities and specifically recognises software as legitimate research output.  The levels of research software submitted as research output have declined sharply over the last 12 years and this differs substantially to the records of software contained in other UK research output metadata (e.g. https://gtr.ukri.org).  Expanding on this work, source data from OpenDOAR, a directory of global Open Access Repositories, were used to apply similar analyses to international IRs in what we believe is the first such census of its kind.  4,970 repositories from 125 countries were examined for the presence of software, along with repository-based metadata for potentially correlating factors.  It appears that much more could be done to provide trivial technical updates to RIS platforms to recognise software as distinct and recordable research output in its own right.  We will discuss the implications of these findings with a focus on the apparent lack of recognition of software as discrete output in the research process.</p>

        <p>As social media platforms continue to shape modern communication, understanding and harnessing the wealth of information they offer has become increasingly crucial. The nature of the data that these platforms provide makes them the emerging resource for data collection to conduct research ranging from measuring sentiments of the people over a particular trend in society to drafting a major policy by governing agencies. This paper presents PULSE, a powerful tool developed by Decision TheaterTM (DT) at Arizona State University in the United States, designed to extract valuable insights from Twitter. PULSE provides researchers and organizations with access to a curated dataset of public opinions and discussions across diverse research areas. Further, the tool uses various machine learning and data analytical algorithms to derive valuable insights on the subject under research. These insights are efficiently displayed using an interactive dashboard to assist the researchers in extracting useful insights to draw appropriate conclusions. The paper also illustrates the technical functionalities and visualization capabilities of the tool with the case study on Hurricane Laura.</p>

        <p>Managing massive volumes of data and effectively making it accessible to researchers poses significant challenges and is a barrier to scientific discovery. In many cases, critical data is locked up in unwieldy file formats or one-off databases and is too large to effectively process on a single machine. This talk explores the role of Kubernetes, an open-source container orchestration platform, in addressing research data management challenges. I will discuss how we are using a set of publicly available open-source and home-grown tools in the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) Data, Analysis, and Visualization (DAV) group to help researchers overcome data-related bottlenecks.</p>
        <p>The talk will begin by providing an overview of the data challenges faced in research data management, including data storage, processing, and analysis. I will highlight Kubernetes' ability to handle large-scale data by leveraging containerization and distributed computing, including distributed storage. Kubernetes allows researchers to encapsulate data processing infrastructure and workflows into portable containers, enabling reproducibility and ease of deployment. Kubernetes can then schedule and manage the resource allocation of these containers to enable efficient utilization of limited computing resources, leading to more efficient data processing and analysis.</p>
        <p>I will discuss some limitations of traditional, siloed approaches to dealing with data and emphasize the need for solutions which foster collaboration. I will highlight how we are using Kubernetes at NREL to facilitate data sharing and cooperation among research teams. Kubernetes' flexible architecture enables the deployment of shared computing environments, such as Apache Superset, where researchers can seamlessly access and analyze shared datasets. Providing the ability to have one research team easily consume data generated by another, utilizing Kubernetes' as a central data platform, is one of the major wins we’ve encountered by adopting the platform.</p>
        <p>Finally, I will showcase real-world use cases from NREL where we have used Kubernetes to solve some persistent data challenges involving large volumes of sensor and monitoring data. I will discuss the challenges we encountered when creating our cluster and making it available as a production-ready resource. I will also discuss the specific suite of tools, including Postgres and Apache Druid for columnar and timeseries data, and Redpanda Kafka for streaming data we have deployed in our infrastructure, and the process that went into the selection of these tools.</p>
        <p>Attendees of this talk will gain insights into how Kubernetes can address data challenges in research data management. This talk aims to provide researchers with a framework and a set of building blocks which have worked well for us, in order for them to unlock the full potential of their data in the era of software-enabled discovery.</p>

        <p>Community resilience assessment is critical for the anticipation, prevention and mitigation of natural and anthropic disaster impacts. In the digital age, this requires reliable and flexible cyberinfrastructure capable of supporting research and decision processes along multiple simultaneous, interconnected concerns. To address this need, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) developed the Interdependent Networked Community Resilience Modeling Environment (IN-CORE) as part of the NIST-funded Center of Excellence for Risk-Based Community Resilience Planning (CoE), headquartered at Colorado State University. The Community App is a web-based application that takes a community through the resilience planning process using IN-CORE analyses for the measurement science to measure community resilience. Complex workflows are managed by DataWolf, a scientific workflow management system, running jobs on the IN-CORE platform utilizing the underlying Kubernetes cluster resources. Using the community app, users can perform realistic and complex scenarios and visualize the results to understand their resilience to different hazards and enhance their decision-making capabilities.</p>

        <p>Full-stack research software projects typically include several components and have many dependencies. New projects benefit from co-development of these components within a well-structured monolith. While this is preferred, over time this can become a burden to deploy in different contexts and environments. What we would like is to independently deploy components to reduce size and complexity. Maintaining separate packages however allows for developmental drift and other problems. So called 'monorepos' allow for the best of both approaches, but not without its own difficulties. There is almost no formal treatment in the literature of this particular dilemma however. The technology industry has started using monorepos to solve similar challenges, but perhaps in the academic context we should be cautious to not simply replicate industry practices. This short paper merely propositions the research software engineering (RSE) community into a discussion of the positives and negatives in structuring projects as monorepos of discrete packages.</p>

The INTERSECT project is an open federated hardware/software library to facilitate the development of autonomous laboratories. A documentation strategy using Sphinx has been utilized to help developers contribute to source code and to help users understand the INTERSECT Python interface. Docstrings as well as reStructuredText files are used by Sphinx to automatically compile HTML and PDF files which can be hosted online as API documentation and user guides. The resulting documentation website is automatically built and deployed using GitLab runners to create Docker containers with NGINX servers. The approach discussed in this paper to automatically deploy documentation for a Python project can improve the user and developer experience for many scientific projects.</p>

        <p>Collaboration networks for university research communities can be readily rendered through the interrogation of coauthorships and coinvestigator data. Subsequent computation of network metrics such as degree or various centralities offer interpretations on collaborativeness and influence and can also compose distributions which can be used to contrast different cohorts. In prior work, this workflow provided quantitative evidence for ROI of centralized computing resources in contrasting researchers with and without cluster accounts, where significance was found across all metrics. In this work, two similar cohorts, those with RSE-type roles at the university and everyone else, are contrasted in a similar vein. While a significantly higher degree statistic for the RSE cohort suggests its collaborative value, a significantly lower betweenness centrality distribution indicates a target for potential impact through the implementation of a centralized RSE network.</p>

        <p>Research software plays a crucial role in advancing research across many domains. However, the complexity of research software often makes it challenging for developers to conduct comprehensive testing, which leads to reduced confidence in the accuracy of the results produced. To address this concern, developers have employed peer code review, a well-established software engineering practice,to improve the reliability of software. However, peer code review is less prevalent in research software than in open-source or traditional software domains. This presentation addresses this topic by describing a previous investigation of peer code review in research software. Then it concludes with a description of our current work and ways for interested people to get involved.</p>
        <p>In our previous study, we interviewed and surveyed 84 developers of research software.The results show research software teams do perform code reviews, albeit without a formalized process, proper organization, or adequate human resources dedicated to conducting reviews effectively. In the talk, we will describe the results in more detail. The application of peer code review holds promise for improving the quality of research software, thereby increasing the reliability of research outcomes. Additionally, adopting peer code review practices enables research software developers to produce code that is more readable, understandable, and maintainable.</p>
        <p>This talk will then briefly outline our current work to engage interested participants. Our current work focuses on peer code review processes as performed specifically by Research Software Engineers (RSEs). The research questions we aim to address in this ongoing study are: RQ1: What processes do RSEs follow when conducting peer code review?; RQ2: What challenges do RSEs encounter during peer code review?; and RQ3: What improvements are required to enhance the peer code review process for RSEs?</p>
        <p>To answer these questions, we plan to conduct the following phases of the project:Phase 1: Surveying RSEs to Gain Insights into Peer Code Review Practices; Phase 2: Conducting Interviews and Focus Groups with RSEs to Explore Peer Code Review Experiences; Phase 3: Observational Study of RSE Peer Code Review</p>
        <p>There are numerous places for members of the US-RSE community to get involved in our research. We will highlight these opportunities in the talk.</p>

        <p>Scientific software plays a crucial and ever-growing role in various fields by facilitating complex modeling, simulation, exploration, and data analysis. However, ensuring the correctness and reliability of these software systems presents significant challenges due to their computational complexity, their explorative nature, and the lack of explicit specifications or even documentations. Traditional testing methods fall short in validating scientific software comprehensively – in particular for explorative software and simulation tools suffer from the Oracle Problem. In fact, Segura et al. show that scientific and explorative software systems are inherently difficult to test. In this context, metamorphic testing is a promising approach that addresses these challenges effectively. By exploiting the inherent properties within scientific problems, metamorphic testing provides a systematic means to validate the accuracy and robustness of scientific software while avoiding the challenges posed by the Oracle Problem. The proposed talk will highlight the importance of metamorphic testing in scientific software, emphasizing its ability to uncover subtle bugs, enhance result consistency, and show approaches for a more rigorous and systematic software development process in the scientific domain.</p>

We discuss our explorations into the TimescaleDB extension, and our eventual decision to use native PostgreSQL with a table-partitioning schema, to best support our data access patterns. Our approach has allowed for flexibility with various forms of timestamped data while scaling to billions of data points and hundreds of experiments.

We are embracing the lessons and technology of the (re)decentralized web to curate a suite of open source tools and web services that prioritize data ownership to give researchers as much control as possible over their data, communications, and access controls. I will present the architecture of our framework as well as example use cases from existing projects ranging from astronomy to nuclear physics, showcasing the flexible deployment system and some collaborative tools and services for identity and access management, messaging, data sharing, code development, documentation, high-performance computing and more.

        <p>Airtable is an increasingly popular format for entering and storing research data, especially in the digital humanities. It combines the simplicity of spreadsheet formats like CSV with a relational database’s ability to model relationships; enterers or viewers of the data do not need to have programming knowledge. The Center for Digital Research in the Humanities at the University of Nebraska uses Airtable data for two projects on which I work as a developer. African Poetics has data focusing on African poets and newspaper coverage of them, and Petitioning for Freedom has data on habeas corpus petitions and involved parties. At the CDRH, our software can take data in many formats, including CSV, and ingest it for an API based on Elasticsearch. This data is then available for search and discovery through web applications built on Ruby on Rails. The first step in ingesting the Airtable data into our system is to download it. I will cover the command line tools that can do this, the formats that can be downloaded (JSON turned out to be the most convenient), and the requirements for authentication. Python (aided by Pandas) can transform this data into the CSV format that our back end software. I will discuss how to rename and delete columns, change data back into JSON (which is sometimes more parsable by our scripts), and clean troublesome values like blanks and NaNs. One advancement of Airtable over CSV is join tables that have similar functionality to SQL databases. Incorporating them into other projects has particular challenges. When downloaded directly from Airtable, the join data is in a format that cannot be interpreted by humans or programs other than Airtable.  But it can be converted (with the help of some processing within airtable) into formats that can be parsed by external scripts so that it can be human-readable. With these transformations, our software can use the table to populate API fields and parse it into arrays and hashes to replicate relationships within the data. Finally I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of Airtable for managing data, from the perspective of a developer who uses the data on the front and back end of web applications.</p>

        <p>In codes used to simulate multi-physics hydrodynamics, it is common for variables to reside on different parts of a mesh, or on different, but related, meshes. For example, in some codes all variables may reside on cell centers, while in others, scalars may reside on cell centers, vectors on cell faces and tensors on cell corners, etc. Further, different methods may be used for the calculation of derivatives or divergences of different variables, or for the interpolation or mapping of variables from one mesh to another. This poses a challenge for libraries of 3D physics models, where the physical processes have dependencies on space, and therefore, mesh dependency. For such libraries to be able to support a general set of multi-physics hydrodynamics host codes, they must be able to represent the physics in a way that is independent of mesh-related details. To solve this problem, we present a Multi-Mesh Operations (MMOPS) library for the mesh-agnostic representation of 3D physics.</p>
        <p>MMOPS is a light-weight C++ abstraction providing an interface for the development of general purpose calculations between variables of different user-defined types, while deferring the specification of the details of these types to be provided by the host code. As an example, consider three variables, a, b, c representing a vector and two scalar quantities residing on the cell corners, cell centers and cell corners of a mesh, respectively. MMOPS provides a `class mapped_variable` to represent these variables, for which the host code provides an arbitrary compile-time tag indicating where the variable data resides on the mesh, and a mapping function method used to indicate how to map the variable from one part of the mesh to another, using tag dispatching under the hood. This way, we can perform operations using `a`, `b`, `c`, namely `mapped_variable` instantiations representing a, b, c, such as `c(i) = a(c.tag(), i, dir) + b(c.tag(), i)` where, `i` is an index representing the ith cell on `c`’s mesh, and `dir` is an index representing the desired directional component of vector `a`. In general, if either `a` or `b` have a different mesh representation than `c`, then they get mapped to `c`’s mesh using the mapping functions provided by the host code when constructing `a` and `b`, which can be different. In the above example, since `a` is on the same mesh as `c`, it doesn’t get mapped but instead is directly accessed, and since `b` lives on a different mesh than `c`, it gets mapped to `c`’s mesh, i.e. to cell corners.</p>
        <p>We demonstrate that MMOPS provides a zero to nearly zero-cost abstraction of the de- scribed functionality, in the sense that it incurs in little to no performance penalty (depending on compiler) compared to a manual benchmark implementation of the same functionality. A description of the library, usage examples, and benchmarking tests will also be presented.</p>

        <p>The High Throughput Discovery Lab at the Rosalind Franklin Institute aims to iteratively expand the reaction toolkit used in drug discovery to enable new regions of biologically relevant chemical space to be explored. The current reaction toolkit, that underpins traditional drug discovery workflows, has to date been dominated by a small number (<10) of reaction classes that have remained largely unchanged for 30 years. It has been argued that this has contributed to attrition and stagnation in drug discovery. We are working to create a semi-automated approach to explore large regions of chemical space to identify novel bioactive molecules. The approach involves creating arrays of hundreds of reactions, in which different pairs of substrates are combined. The design of subsequent reaction arrays is informed by the biological activity of the products that are obtained. However, the multi-step laboratory process to create, purify and test the reaction products introduces high requirements for data linkage, making data management incredibly important. </p>
        <p>This talk focuses on how we built the data infrastructure using a mix of open-source and licensed technology. We will discuss how the Franklin aims to increase automation in data processing and how the technology we have implemented will make this possible.</p>

        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have been shown to be increasingly helpful tools in a growing number of use-cases relevant to scientific research, despite significant software-related obstacles. There exist large technical costs to setting up, using, and maintaining AI/ML models in production. This often prevents researchers from utilizing these models in their work. The growing field of machine learning operations (MLOps) aims to automate much of the AI/ML life cycle while increasing access to these models. This paper presents the initial work in creating a nuclear energy MLOps platform for use by researchers at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) and aims to reduce the barriers of using AI/ML in scientific research. Our goal is to promote the integration of the latest AI/ML technologies into researchers' workflows and create more opportunity for scientific innovation. In this paper we discuss how our MLOps efforts aim to increase usage and the impact of AI/ML models created by researchers. We also present several use-cases that are currently integrated. Finally, we evaluate the maturity of our project as well as our plans for future functionality.</p>

        <p>Machine learning models, specifically neural networks, have garnered extensive recognition due to their remarkable performance across various domains. Nevertheless, concerns pertaining to their robustness and interpretability have necessitated the immediate requirement for comprehensive methodologies and tools. This scholarly article introduces the "Adversarial Observation" framework, which integrates adversarial and explainable techniques into the software development cycle to address these crucial aspects.</p>
        <p>Industry practitioners have voiced an urgent need for tools and guidance to fortify their machine learning systems. Research studies have underscored the fact that a substantial number of organizations lack the necessary tools to tackle adversarial machine learning and ensure system security. Furthermore, the absence of consensus on interpretability in machine learning presents a significant challenge, with minimal agreement on evaluation benchmarks. These concerns highlight the pivotal role played by the Adversarial Observation framework.</p>
        <p>The Adversarial Observation framework provides model-agnostic algorithms for adversarial attacks and interpretable techniques. Two notable methods, namely the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and the Adversarial Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO) technique, have been implemented. These methods reliably generate adversarial noise, enabling the evaluation of model resilience against attacks and the training of less vulnerable models.</p>
        <p>In terms of explainable AI (XAI), the framework incorporates activation mapping to visually depict and analyze significant input regions driving model predictions. Additionally, a modified APSO algorithm fulfills a dual purpose by determining global feature importance and facilitating local interpretation. This systematic assessment of feature significance reveals underlying decision rules, enhancing transparency and comprehension of machine learning models.</p>
        <p>By incorporating the Adversarial Observation framework, organizations can assess the resilience of their models, address biases, and make well-informed decisions. The framework plays a pivotal role in the software development cycle, ensuring the highest standards of transparency and reliability. It empowers a deeper understanding of models through visualization, feature analysis, and interpretation, thereby fostering trust and facilitating the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, the Adversarial Observation framework represents a crucial milestone in the development of trustworthy and dependable AI systems. Its integration of robustness, interpretability, and fairness into the software development cycle enhances transparency and reliability. By addressing vulnerabilities and biases, organizations can make well-informed decisions, improve fairness, and establish trust with stakeholders. The significance of the framework is further underscored by the pressing need for tools expressed by industry practitioners and the lack of consensus on interpretability in machine learning. Ultimately, the Adversarial Observation framework contributes to the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies, fostering public trust and promoting the adoption of AI systems in critical domains.</p>

        <p>The expected long-term outcome of our research is to determine the ways in which a focus on scientific model code quality can improve both scientific reliability and model performance. In this work, we focus on climate models which are complex software implementations of the scientific and mathematical abstractions of systems that govern the climate.</p>
        <p>Climate models integrate the physical understanding of climate and produce simulations of climate patterns. The model code is often hundreds of thousands of lines of highly sophisticated software, written in high-performance languages such as Fortran. These models are developed with teams of experts, including climate scientists and high-performance computing developers. The sheer complexity of the software behind the climate models (which have evolved over many years) makes them vulnerable to performance, usability, and maintainability bugs that hinder performance and weaken scientific confidence. Understanding how the social structures behind the software and model function have been examined but the complex interactions of domain experts and software experts are poorly understood. </p>
        <p>The expected short-term outcomes of our research are a) develop a set of software quality indicators for the climate models, providing model maintainers and users with specific areas to improve the model code; b) develop new techniques for analyzing large bodies of unstructured text to explain how users perceive a research software project’s capabilities and failings aligned with international efforts to improve the quality of scientific software.</p>
        <p>We follow two main approaches. (1) <i>Analytics</i>: analysis of climate models and their artifacts. These artifacts include the software code itself, including the way the model is deployed and run with end users; the bug reports and other feedback on the software quality; and the simulation testing used to validate the model outputs. Our analysis will be incorporated into a Fortran analysis tool to identify Fortran quality issues automatically. This analysis is incomplete however without a clear understanding of the social context in which it was produced. (2) <i>Social Context</i>: we examine the socio-technical artifacts created around climate models. These include a) outputs from workshops, interviews, and surveys with stakeholders, including climate scientists and model software developers; b) explicit issue and bug reports recorded on the model, such as the fact the model is failing/crashing at a particular place; c) implicitly discussed software problems and feature requests from related discussion forums. We hypothesize that both approaches will help to identify technical debts in the climate models.</p>
        <p>Manually eliciting software requirements from these diverse sources of feedback can be time-consuming and expensive. Hence, we will use state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches that require less human effort. The web artifacts, interviews, and scientific texts of climate models provide reflections on the Climate Community of Practice (CoP). We will use an unsupervised topic model, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to study how different narratives (such as specific modules of climate models, research interests, and needs of the community members) of a climate CoP have evolved over a period. </p>
        <p>LDA assumes that documents are mixtures of topics, and a topic is a probability distribution over words. The gist of a topic can be inferred from its most probable words. We focus on the discussion forum of the Community Earth System Model (CESM). CESM is a collaboratively developed fully coupled global climate model focused on computer simulations of Earth's climate states. </p>
        <p>We infer 15 topics on around 7000 posts from the year 2003 to 2023 on the discussion forum using MALLET topic modeling library. We ask a domain expert to assign a label to a topic and use the labels to analyze the posts. We plot the proportions of words in a document assigned to a topic over a period. We observe certain trends over around 20 years. The topic of <i>version management of CESM models</i> gained attention from 2018 on-wards till 2021. There is a steady increase in discussion of the topic of <i>Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) and Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs)</i>. Discussions about issues related to <i>installing and setting up CESM models</i> and <i>parallel computing</i> have declined since 2016 and 2020 respectively. Topics of <i>source code related changes</i>, <i>ocean modeling</i>, and <i>errors encountered while running CESM models</i> are discussed throughout the period. We also observe that questions related to <i>parallel computing</i> received fewer responses, while questions related to <i>compiling CESM models</i> received higher responses. These trends and insights can be used by the software engineering group of CESM to prioritize its actions to facilitate the use of the models. </p>
        <p>We believe that this qualitative study scaffolded using topic models will complement climate science research by facilitating the generation of software requirements, onboarding of new users of the models, responding to new problems using solutions to similar problems, and preventing reinvention.</p>

        <p>Alchemical free energy methods, which can estimate relative potency of potential drugs by computationally transmuting one molecule into another, have become key components of drug discovery pipelines. Despite many ongoing innovations in this area, with several methodological improvements published every year, it remains challenging to consistently run free energy campaigns using state-of-the-art tools and best practices. In many cases, doing so requires expert knowledge, and/or the use of expensive closed source software. The Open Free Energy project (https://openfree.energy/) was created to address these issues. The consortium, a joint effort between several academic and industry partners, aims to create and maintain reproducible and extensible open source tools for running large scale free energy campaigns.</p>

It will describe the kind of scientific discovery enabled by the Open Free Energy ecosystem, approaches in the core packages to facilitate reproducibility, efforts to enhance scalability, and our work toward more community engagement, including interactions with both industry and with academic drug discovery work.

        <p>Background: The NSAPH (National Studies on Air Pollution and Health) lab focuses on analyzing the impact of air pollution on public health. Typically, studies in Environmental Health require merging diverse datasets coming from multiple domains such as health, exposures, and population demographics. Exposure data is obtained from various sources and presented in different formats, posing challenges in data management and integration. The manual process of extracting and aggregating data is repetitive, inefficient, and prone to errors. Harmonizing formats and standards is difficult due to the mix of public and proprietary data sources. Reproducibility is crucial in scientific work, but the heavy computations involved in processing exposure data are sensitive to the computational environment, making different versions of components potentially affect the results. Additionally, while some exposure data are public datasets that are shareable for reproducible research, there are some exceptions of proprietary data, such as ESRI shapefile, that cannot be publicly shared, further complicating reproducibility efforts in NSAPH.</p>
        <p>Aim: Our main objective is to leverage our expertise in bioinformatics to create a robust data platform tailored for aggregating exposure and spatial data. We are building a data platform that is focused on exposure data, such as pollution, temperature, humidity, and smoke. This platform incorporates a deployment system, package management capabilities, and a configuration toolkit to ensure compatibility and generalizability across various spatial aggregations, such as zip code, ZCTA (zip code tabulation areas), and counties. Through the development of this data platform, our aim is to streamline exposure data processing, enable efficient transformation of exposure data, and facilitate reproducibility in working with exposure data.</p>
        <p>Methods: The methodology employed in this study utilizes the CWL (Common Workflow Language) programming language for the data pipeline. Docker is utilized for deployment purposes, while PostgreSQL serves as the data warehouse. Apache Superset is employed for data exploration and visualization. The study incorporates various types of data transformations, including isomorphic transformations for reversible conversions and union transformations for combining data from different sources. Additionally, rollups are performed to extract specific data elements, and approximations are used for imprecise conversions. In the case of tabular data, simple aggregations are conducted using SQL functions. For spatial operations, the methodology includes adjustable rasterization methods such as downscaling and resampling (nearest, majority). Furthermore, a data loader is developed to handle diverse spatial file types, including NetCDF, Parquet, CSV, and FST.</p>
        <p>Results: We developed DORIEH (data for observational research in environmental health), a comprehensive system designed for the transformation and storage of exposure data. Within this system, we implemented various utilities, notably the gridMET   (Grid-based Meteorological Ensemble Tool) data pipeline, which encompasses multiple crucial steps. These steps include retrieving shapefiles from an API, importing exposure spatial data, aggregating exposure data from grids into selected spatial aggregations (e.g ZCTA, county, zip codes) utilizing adaptable rasterization methods, and ultimately storing the transformed data into our dedicated database. Furthermore, we constructed a versatile data loader capable of handling diverse file types, while also incorporating parallelization techniques to enhance processing efficiency. Additionally, DORIEH provides basic visualization capabilities that serve as quality checks for the data.</p>
        <p>Conclusion: Our study addresses the challenges faced by the NSAPH group in analyzing the impact of environmental exposures on health. By developing the DORIEH data platform and implementing various utilities, including the flexible and configurable spatial aggregation data pipeline and a flexible data loader, we have made significant progress in overcoming the limitations of manual data extraction and aggregation. The platform enables streamlined exposure data processing, efficient transformation, and storage, while ensuring compatibility and reproducibility in working with exposure and spatial data.</p>

        <p>Accurately capturing the huge span of dynamical scales in astrophysical systems often requires vast computing resources such as those provided by exascale supercomputers. The majority of computational throughput for the first exascale supercomputers is expected to come from hardware accelerators such as GPUs. These accelerators, however, will likely come from a variety of manufacturers. Each vendors uses its low-level programming interface (such as CUDA and HIP) which can require moderate to significate code development. While performance portability frameworks such as Kokkos allow research software engineers to target multiple architectures with one code base, adoption at the application level lags behind. To address this issue in computational fluid dynamics, we developed Parthenon, a performance portable framework for block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), a staple feature of many fluid dynamics methods. Parthenon drives a number of astrophysical and terrestrial plasma evolution codes including AthenaPK, a performance portable magnetohydroynamics (MHD) astrophysics code based on the widely used Athena++ code. Running AthenaPK on Frontier, the world’s first exascale supercomputer, we explore simulations of galaxy clusters with feedback from a central supermassive black hole. These simulations further understanding of the thermalization of feedback in galaxy clusters.

        <p>To address the lack of software development and engineering training for intermediate and advanced developers of research software, we present INnovative Training Enabled by a Research Software Engineering Community of Trainers (INTERSECT). INTERSECT, funded by NSF, provides expert-led training courses designed to build a pipeline of researchers trained in best practices for research software development. This training will enable researchers to produce better software and, for some, assume the role of Research Software Engineer (RSE). </p>
        <p>INTERSECT sponsors an annual RSE-trainer workshop, focused on the curation and communal generation of research software engineering training material. These workshops connect RSE practitioner-instructors from across the country to leverage knowledge from multiple institutions and to strengthen the RSE community. The first workshop, held in 2022 laid the foundation for the format, structure, and content for the INTERSECT bootcamp, a multi-day, hands-on, research software engineering training event.</p>
        <p>INTERSECT brings together RSE instructors from U.S. institutions to exploit the expertise of a growing RSE community. In July 2023, INTERSECT will sponsor a week-long bootcamp for intermediate and advanced participants from U.S. institutions. We will use an existing open-source platform to make the INTERSECT-curated material from the bootcamp available. The public availability of the material allows the RSE community to continually engage with the training material and helps coordinate the effort across the RSE-trainer community.</p>
        <p>In this talk we will introduce the INTERSECT project. We will discuss outcomes of the 2023 bootcamp, including curriculum specifics, lessons learned, and long term objectives. We will also describe how people can get involved as contributors or participants.</p>
