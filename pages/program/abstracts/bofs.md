## Alternative Routes to Becoming a Research Software Engineer: The Role of Doctorate and Essential Skills

_Session leader: Joanne Sheppard_

Research Software Engineering (RSE) is a field that requires a diverse range of
skills, including software development, data management, and research methods.
However, there is no single route to becoming an RSE, and the value of obtaining
a doctorate in this field is often debated. This panel brings together experts
in the field of RSE to discuss alternative routes to becoming an RSE, the role
of obtaining a doctorate, and the essential skills that are necessary for
success in this field.

The panel will explore the benefits and drawbacks of different paths to becoming
an RSE, including formal education programs, on-the-job training, and self-taught
skills. We will also examine the value of obtaining a doctorate in this field,
including the advantages and disadvantages of a PhD versus a master's degree or
other formal qualifications.

In addition, the panel will discuss the skills that are most important for an
RSE, such as programming languages, software development practices,
project management, and communication. We will consider how these skills can be
developed and measured, and how they can be used to evaluate and recruit RSEs.

Overall, this panel aims to provide a comprehensive and insightful discussion
of the different routes to becoming an RSE, the role of obtaining a doctorate
in this field, and the essential skills that are necessary for success.
Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of the field of RSE and the skills
required to excel in this exciting and rapidly evolving field.

## Code Review for Research Software

_Session leaders: Cole Crawford, Jeffrey Tharsen_

Many academic research projects require custom software development. These developers are often a
consortium of researchers, academic staff and professional software developers. As the field has
matured, the question of testing and reviewing software to confirm it works properly has become an
important topic, as nearly all software will have errors (some small, some potentially significant) in the
code. A rough estimate suggests that there are between 15 to 50 errors in 1000 lines of code written by
professional software developers (Soergel 2015). While most errors do not have any substantive effect
on research findings, there are plenty of cases where this has happened (see for example Letzner et al.
2020 or Miller 2006). In addition, uncaught “edge cases” can drastically affect future researchers’
results.

Code Review is a common technique used in industry to improve software and reduce the number of
flaws. In a code review process, a software engineer other than the original code author(s) reviews the
source code. They ask questions and make suggestions for improving the software. In addition to
identifying and eliminating errors, code review can improve overall quality by making the source code
more readable and the overall product more sustainable. Furthermore, code reviews improve not just
the skills of the reviewee but also those of the reviewer. If a code author and reviewer work in the same
team or on the same or related projects, code reviews can also support team cohesion and facilitate
information-sharing within a team.

Unfortunately, code review is not widely used in many research disciplines. The reasons for this vary
widely. Many research software projects have only one core developer who does all the coding with no
colleagues to review their code. Some projects avoid reviews by developers external to the project out of
concern that their code could be plagiarized or their license ignored. In other cases, the person
developing the code is concerned that they or their work will be attacked for being of poor quality or
producing erroneous results. We suggest a BoF featuring a panel of three experts who will present
best practices, tutorials and guidelines for code review from the perspectives of different
disciplines. Following the panel we will host an open discussion and Q&A with the audience; the
following questions are among those we propose to address:

- Are certain challenges associated mainly with specific disciplines, or are there commonalities across disciplines?
- Is code review across disciplines useful?

A pilot study conducted by Petre and Wilson (2013) suggests that there is value in
code reviews even if the reviewers do not possess any domain expertise for the code they are reviewing;
in their study, professional software engineers from Mozilla reviewed code written by scientists. The
goal of this BoF is to help attendees to better understand the code review processes of different RSE
teams across disciplines, and explore the value of code review undertaken by researchers for researchers.

## Get Involved with pyOpenSci! Building diverse community around scientific Python open source software through peer review, training and mentorship

_Session leaders: Leah Wasser, David Nicholson_

pyOpenSci is building a diverse community around the Python open source
software that drives open science. Attend this BoF session to learn about
submitting a Python package to pyOpenSci's open peer review process, and
how you as a research software engineer will benefit from our supportive
review process. You'll also learn about best practices for pure Python
packaging that are documented in our guide that we've recently updated with
significant input from maintainers of Python packaging tools, core scientific
packages and the broader community.

Founded in 2018, pyOpenSci's core program is open peer review of scientific
software with the goal of improving the quality, usability, discoverability
and long-term maintenance of scientific packages. We also focus on diversifying
the community through both community partnerships, and support for communities
that have not been traditionally a part of the Python open space but who have
interest in participating. Through our partnership with JOSS (Journal of Open
Source Software), we also offer a publication win-win to maintainers who are
interested in both Python modern best practices, long term community support
and also formal publication of their software.

Community is core to our organization. As such understanding the needs of 
esearch software engineers working in the scientific Python space is critical
as we develop our organization's structure, programs and goals.

In this BoF session, we will discuss and ask for feedback on four things:

1. We will review our open peer review process and how you can submit a package to us for review.
1. We will talk about our community governance and how we are actively engaging with a variety of communities with the core goal of diversifying the Python open source space.
1. We will answer questions and get feedback on our process to ensure that we are supporting research software engineers that are working on Python tools.
1. We will talk about the community work that we are doing to create useful Python packaging and contributor resources that support modern approaches to Python packaging

This BoF will be relevant to anyone interested in US-RSEcon 2023's theme
enabling software, because pyOpenSci is empowering a diverse community to drive
open science forward by building Python open source tools. The format of this
session will be a mixture of short "how to" overviews followed by discussion
sessions that solicit feedback.

## Notebooks as a Possible Future for Scientific Publication, Better Practices for Sharing Software, and RSE Authorship

_Session leaders: Kenton McHenry, Nicole Brewer, Daniel S. Katz_

Software is now a key part of just about all scientific research and as such
the need to support this need within science has gotten a lot of attention. One
area of particular interest by funding agencies, such as NSF who invest in
scientific software development, is that of sustainability and reusability
so as to maximize the gains from these investments from research funds. One
approach to scientific software sharing and reusability is that of utilizing
computational notebooks as the paper itself, with it as the peer reviewed
scholarly object. Such an effort was leveraged by the NSF EarthCube program
n the last 3 years as a means of not only making software investments within
geoscience more discoverable and reusable, but to also motivate the community
itself to go through the needed effort of documenting and packaging their
software in this manner through the peer review process which carries weight
within academic reward systems. Given its success here the AGU put in and was
awarded a grant from the Sloan Foundation to carry this further, bring together
publishers and other stakeholders to work out the details as to how publications
can actually be transition such that notebook submissions might actually replace
paper submissions where appropriate and still be indexed, discovered, and
accessed with existing publication systems and processes.

Computational notebooks are also increasingly important tools for research and
science communication as they can be used to teach, showcase tools, communicate
research results, and provide friendly interfaces to interact with data and
software. To this end, US-RSE’23 Conference accepted submissions for reproducible
notebooks (that were rendered to HTML documents), and interactive notebooks
(that were hosted on Binder). Drafting a rubric for better practices was
exceptionally difficult for interactive notebooks which are, by definition, not
fully-reproducible due to widgets or other expected user-inputs. In addition,
all software inevitably becomes unrunnable without maintenance. How then,
should we ensure the reproducibility of our notebooks? And should this be a
lasting or ephemeral goal? These are open questions the notebook subcommittee
had to reckon with as they formulated better practices for peer review and we
feel that they are worth opening up to the RSE community at large.

We propose to bring together a Birds of a Feather at US-RSE’23 to introduce
these efforts as an area of interest for RSEs as well as explore the state of
things right now and the areas that still need to be worked out. The format of
the BoF will be in the form of a panel followed by a menti driven discussion
with the audience. The panel will consist of representatives from notebook and
notebook tool (e.g. binder) providers, AGU, and members of the US-RSE’23
notebooks subcommittee to discuss where each is going in terms of
supporting/using notebooks.

## Polyglot Software Development and Language Interoperation

_Session leader: Mark Kittisopikul_

This Birds of a Feather session will discuss the use of multiple
programming languages and interoperation between them. Software development
in the research environment requires the integration of existing and new tools
employing a variety of programming languages. New programming languages are
arising to fill unmet needs and new niches such as Rust, Zig, Go, and Julia.
Yet, the use of these languages in ongoing research requires that they
integrate with traditional programming languages such as Python, R, Java, and
C++. I will draw upon my personal experience with working on JavaCPP projects,
JavaCall.jl for Julia-Java interop, and building language bindings around the
HDF5 C library (Malone 2014). I also hope to invite collaborators working at
the interface of Java and Python in the context of FIJI (ImageJ) (Schindelin
2012, Rueden 2022). The session will incorporate both traditional approaches
such via foreign function interfaces and the SWIG interface compiler and new
approaches made possible by coding assistants such as a Github Copilot. The
BoF is meant to gather project managers and software development engineers
interested in sharing best practices for integrating more than one programming
language into a single project and sharing data across language barriers.

The proposed format is to offer several, three or four, 10 minute talks about
projects that facilitate interoperation between languages or a presentation of
a project that uses multiple programming languages. An interactive roundtable
discussion will then follow with attendees sharing their experience with
attempting to use multiple programming languages together. An alternative
format is to have the speakers lead a panel based discussion while encouraging
audience participation. The choice of format will depend on the number of
participants.

The overall goal of the BoF is to lower the barriers of including multiple
languages in a project so that the best languages can be used to accomplish
particular tasks. By collecting project managers and developers from diverse
programming backgrounds, the BoF hopes to foster relationships across language
boundaries.

## What does it mean to be an RSE at a National Lab?

_Session leaders: Keith Beattie, Rinku Gupta, William Godoy, Daniel Howard, Anshu Dubey, David E. Bernholdt, Daniel Gunter_

Although the research software engineering (RSE) community originated in
universities, RSEs also find a place in National Laboratories confronting
comparable but distinct challenges as those at universities and other research
institutions. This BoF seeks to provide a forum for those who identify as RSEs
and those supportive or curious about the community, to deliberate upon
challenges faced at national labs in order to explore approaches or solutions
that might enhance their professional and scientific pursuits. Additionally,
this forum can be used to discuss avenues for RSEs across labs to exchange
information as well as define meaningful relationships beyond National Labs
with university and industry affiliated RSEs.

The structure of the BoF proposed is to start with an overall introduction,
two short presentations from RSEs at labs that currently have an established
RSE framework, then break out into smaller groups to discuss a predefined set
of topics and questions. The BoF will conclude with a panel discussion, led by
representatives from various national labs, to find the common or unique issues
faced by RSEs at national labs and develop solutions for improving the RSE
experience within national lab ecosystems.

The topics covered will be chosen from, but not limited to:

- How does being an RSE vary from lab to lab or as compared to universities or industry?
- What are the RSE career paths at labs and how are they supported? What opportunities or support is missing?
- How are RSEs funded at labs and how can this be improved?
- What can be done to improve recruitment & retention strategies, specifically for DEI?
- How do labs currently organize RSEs or groups of RSEs? What has worked well across different labs?
- What training or opportunities should be made available for RSEs

We welcome a broad audience both from national labs and otherwise, to provide contrast and context to the discussions,
expecting somewhere between 10-20 people in attendance.
