## Kick-off Event 
Monday, 12:00 PM (Co-located with Lunch) 
 
Start your conference experience by joining us at the 
Student Tables during the Lunch session on the first 
day. This is a great opportunity to meet fellow students 
and mentors, setting the stage for an engaging 
scavenger hunt.

## Student Social 
Monday, 7:00 PM - 10:00 PM 
 
This is a closed event. Find information about the student 
social in your Mentorship Program passport.

## Closing Ceremonies 
Wednesday, 12:00 PM (Co-located with Lunch) 
 
Concluding the conference, the Closing Ceremonies 
offer a final chance to meet with the mentors and 
students before going on your way. Join us at the 
Student Tables during lunch on the final day as we will 
hand out raffle prizes to those who have obtained the 
most initials (see the Scavenger Hunt Details on the next 
page for more information). Don't forget to set up follow-
up meetings with those you want to keep in touch with!
