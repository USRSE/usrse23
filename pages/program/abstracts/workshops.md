## Emerging as a Team Leader through Cultural Challenges

_Angela Herring and Elaine Raybourn_

In this interactive workshop we explore how meeting technical objectives depends
critically on meeting cultural challenges within teams. Many small teams evolve
naturally on a positive path because teams are often formed by friendly
collaborators with common interests and goals. But as teams grow, they face
new challenges, including fragmented time commitments, physically distributed
developers, and growing numbers of stakeholders. These challenges make it
significantly harder to maintain a healthy team culture. In addition, it
becomes important to understand how to identify and responsibly use one’s
informal influence to navigate organizations and galvanize team members.
Although agile methodologies and modern software tools can help developers
manage these challenges, these processes alone are insufficient. Thus, a
growing number of teams are combining these methodologies with techniques
that support a collaborative culture. We explore lightweight progress tracking,
informal "tea-time", hybrid scrums, human-centered design, empathy building,
listening games, and hands on exercises with Legos. The session is 180 min of
guided small group exercises and debriefing, followed by 30 min of large group
discussion and retrospective. We recap lessons learned and explore how culture
affects team performance and emerging as a team leader. We focus on skill
building in intercultural and interpersonal communication, and inclusion.

**NOTE**: Attendance is capped at 18 attendees for this workshop.

## [Software Engineering for Research Software Engineering (SE4RSE’23)](https://se4science.org/workshops/se4rse23/index.htm)

_Jeffrey Carver, Neil Chue Hong, Miranda Mundt_

This half-day (3.5 hour) workshop focuses on understanding appropriate software
engineering practices employed by Research Software Engineers to design, develop,
maintain, evolve, and sustain research software. As a result of the variety and
complexity of the research domains addressed by this software, it is unclear to
what extent existing software engineering practices and tools developed for
industrial software are efficient and effective for its development. Appropriate
software engineering approaches must account for the salient characteristics
of the research-oriented development environment. This workshop provides a
platform for RSEs to share their software engineering experiences (both
positive and negative) and learn from each other. We will devote a significant
portion of the workshop to focused interactions to identify common experiences,
needs, and opportunities for future work.

## Unlocking the Potential of HPC in the Cloud with Open-Source Tools

_Google Cloud Team_

Cloud computing technologies have seen tremendous growth in recent years, with
many organizations moving their high–performance computing (HPC) workloads to
the cloud due to its flexibility in the organization and provisioning of HPC
infrastructure. While such a diverse and flexible set of options brings
additional degrees of freedom, they also bring a daunting set of hardware and
software choices. In this tutorial, we will provide a foundation to understand
how to run HPC workloads in the cloud effectively and with minimal complexity.
We will start with a primer on cloud foundations and how they map to common
HPC concepts, and then dive deeper into core HPC cloud components. We then
introduce important HPC partners and discuss industry-specific solutions.
Finally, we will present the best practices to run HPC in the cloud and how to
explore your options for the best configuration for price/performance. This
tutorial will use a combination of lectures and hands-on labs using Google
Cloud, the open-source Google Cloud HPC Toolkit, Slurm, Spack, and other
popular open-source HPC software to provide a balance of both theoretical and
hands-on learning.
