## Software-Enabled Discovery Through Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion


<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/MaryAnnLeung.jpg" alt="Mary Ann Leung, SHI" style="float:right; padding:1em; width:350px">

Research software engineering is an exciting, rapidly growing, and evolving field,
as demonstrated by the inaugural US-Research Software Engineering Association
Annual Conference.  The field is inherently multi- and interdisciplinary and the
US-RSE strives to build a thriving community focused on enabling discovery through
scientific software.  One of the core community goals is building a diverse and
inclusive US-RSE ecosystem. This session will explore a portfolio of programs and
activities aimed at increasing diversity, promoting equity, and building a workforce
where inclusion is the norm.  We will identify some of the key challenges and
success and share lessons learned.

### Mary Ann Leung

Dr. Leung is a nationally acclaimed leader in the design and implementation of
innovative programs aimed at developing the next generation of computing sciences
leaders.  She is the founder and President of Sustainable Horizons Institute, a
501 (c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to cultivating a diverse workforce
prepared to be leaders and add new dimensions to innovation.  She heads up a
variety of programs aimed at diversifying the U.S. Department of Energy National
Laboratory workforce as well as catalyzing change in the broader professional
community to normalize inclusion.  In addition to programmatic work, the
organization consults with organizations and provides recommendations on
workforce development, diversity, and inclusion.  She serves on the U.S.
Department of Energy Advanced Scientific Computing Advisory Committee, as an
Editor for the Diversity and Inclusion department for the Computing in Science
and Engineering Magazine, and served on the Congressionally mandated National
Academies study of the NASA University Leadership Initiative.

A computational chemist by training, Dr. Leung is an experienced author and
researcher.  Her research interests include the development of scalable,
parallel, scientific codes for the investigation of quantum mechanical phenomena
with applications in quantum computing as well as STEM education, workforce
development, diversity, and inclusion. She graduated with honors from Mills
College, earning a B.A. in chemistry with a minor in math.  Dr. Leung holds
Ph.D. and an M.S. degrees in computational physical chemistry from the
University of Washington.

## Research software engineering – from “what” and “where” to “why” and “how”: looking to the future of Software Enabled Discovery

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/NeilChueHong.jpeg" alt="Neil Chue Hong, EPCC" style="float:left; padding:1em; width:350px">

For ten years, we’ve discussed “what” an RSE is, “what” they do, and “where”
they should sit. In this talk, I’ll reflect on the successes that have been
made by RSEs to support Software Enabled Discovery, but I’ll also look into
the future to ask “why” research software engineering is important and “how”
we might. How can the profession continue to mature, how can it become more
diverse and accessible, and how can it be better seen as meaningful and relevant
to society? I will also look at why we should look to other areas to understand
the next ten years of RSE.

### Neil Chue Hong

Neil P. Chue Hong is the founding Director of the Software Sustainability
Institute and Professor of Research Software Policy and Practice at EPCC,
University of Edinburgh. He works to improve software sustainability, research
software engineering practices, and the impact of research software policy and
incentives. He has contributed to international research software guidelines
including the FAIR Principles for Research Software, Software Citation Principles,
and NISO Reproducibility Badging and Definitions. He holds a number of advisory
roles, including chairing the steering committee for the UK’s exascale software,
algorithms and infrastructure programme (ExCALIBUR) and membership of the UKRI
Advisory Committee on Digital Research Infrastructure. He is the Editor-in-Chief
for the Journal of Open Research Software, co-editor of “Software Engineering
for Science,” and co-author of “Best Practices for Scientific Computing” and
“An Open Science Peer Review Oath”. He is a member of the Association for
Computing Machinery, a member of the Society for Research Software Engineering,
and a Fellow of the British Computer Society.
