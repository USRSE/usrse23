Due to the influx of COVID cases in the Chicago area, we will be applying a **mask
mandate** for conference attendees. While in official conference events,
**masks must be worn at all times**, excluding those who have a documented
medical reason and during active eating and drinking. Repeat offenders may be
asked to leave the conference area.

Presenters will not be required to wear masks during their presentations.

To report a medical exception or for any other questions, please [email the
organizers](mailto:usrsecon2023@easychair.org).
