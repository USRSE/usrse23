We are looking for volunteers to be program committee members to assist in the
reviewing process. If you are interested in becoming a reviewer, please fill
out the [Program Committee Interest Form](https://forms.gle/kx1d4qq9iVkLHB21A)
by **May 1, 2023**. 
 
Each reviewer will be assigned no more than 2 to 4 submissions total
(depending on submission type) with about one month time to complete the reviews.  
 
### Details

- As a reviewer you agree to follow the US-RSE [Code of Conduct](https://us-rse.org/about/code-of-conduct/). 
- We will send out more specific review instructions per submission type after
  reviewer selection. The
  [reviewer guidelines from SciPy](https://www.scipy2023.scipy.org/chair-reviewer-guidelines)
  are a good reference to begin with.
- To increase transparency and openness, we are encouraging the use of signed
  reviews as part of our review process.
  - If you agree to provide a signed review, your name will be visible to
  authors along with your review feedback. Signed reviews have an
  [overwhelming positive effect](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/open-peer-review-a-randomised-controlled-trial/1F81447FC67B3BAFDCCCCE82B6C7A187)
  on the overall quality of scientific work!
