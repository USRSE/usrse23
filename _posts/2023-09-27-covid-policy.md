Due to the influx of COVID cases in the Chicago area, we will be applying a **mask
mandate** for conference attendees. While in official conference events,
**masks must be worn at all times**, excluding those who have a documented
medical reason and during active eating and drinking. Repeat offenders may be
asked to leave the conference area.

Presenters will not be required to wear masks during their presentations.
