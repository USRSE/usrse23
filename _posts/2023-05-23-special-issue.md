We are happy to announce that Sandra Gesing and Patrick Diehl are acting as
Special Issue Editors for US-RSE'23.

They are looking into options to invite accepted and presented submissions to
US-RSE'23 to submit to a special issue in a suitable journal post-conference.

Authors of selected submissions will receive the invitation after the conference.
