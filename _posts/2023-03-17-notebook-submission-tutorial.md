As this is our first year accepting notebook submissions, we anticipate this being a productive 
session with lots of Q&A. This session will be recorded for reference.

**Date:** April 7, 2023 

**Time:** 3:00 PM EDT, 2:00 PM CDT, 1:00 PM MDT, 12:00 PM MST, 12:00 PM PDT

[Submission of computational notebooks](https://us-rse.org/usrse23/submissions/notebooks/) are due 
Monday, May 1, 2023. To account for the broad variety of use cases for notebooks, we are accepting 
submissions in three categories, which were described in detail in the [March 2023 Community Call](https://youtu.be/Z4QXKDIDu6k). 
and are available on the [Notebooks Submissions](https://us-rse.org/usrse23/submissions/notebooks/) page. 
Submitters should use our [Jupyter](https://github.com/USRSE/jupyter-notebook-templates) and 
[R Notebook](https://github.com/USRSE/R-notebook-templates) templates to submit. In order to 
improve the clarity of our expectations, we are hosting a tutorial session. We will...

- briefly review the different submission types
- explain how to select and copy the appropriate template for your language and usecase
- walk through the technical details of using our templates to submit a notebook
- give a quick overview of the peer review process
